<h1 style="color:SaddleBrown;"> Mars Facts </h1>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is the second smallest planet in the solar system. Named after<br>
    the Roman god of war, Mars is also often described as the “Red Planet” due to its reddish appearance.<br>
    Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>Facts about Mars</h2>
<ul>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">Even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume and just over 10% of the Earth’s mass, around two<br>
        thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of the Earth’s<br>
        (meaning you could leap nearly three times higher on Mars).</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Mars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar system.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">Olympus Mons, a shield volcano, is 21km high and 600km in diameter. Despite having formed over<br>
        billions of years, evidence from volcanic lava flows is so recent many scientists believe it could still be<br>
        active.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Only 18 missions to Mars have been successful.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">As of September 2014 there have been 40 missions to Mars, including orbiters, landers and rovers but<br>
        not counting flybys. The most recent arrivals include the Mars Curiosity mission in 2012, the MAVEN<br>
        mission, which arrived on September 22, 2014, followed by the Indian Space Research Organization’s<br>
        MOM Mangalyaan orbiter, which arrived on September 24, 2014. The next missions to arrive will be the<br>
        European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, comprising an orbiter, lander, and a rover, followed by<br>
        NASA’s InSight robotic lander mission, slated for launch in March 2016 and a planned arrival in<br>
        September, 2016.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">They can last for months and cover the entire planet. The seasons are extreme because its elliptical<br>
        (oval-shaped) orbital path around the Sun is more elongated than most other planets in the solar<br>
        system.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>On Mars the Sun appears about half the size as it does on Earth.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">At the closest point to the Sun, the Martian southern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a short,<br>
        intensely hot summer, while the northern hemisphere endures a brief, cold winter: at its farthest point<br>
        from the Sun, the Martian northern hemisphere leans towards the Sun, causing a long, mild summer,<br>
        while the southern hemisphere endures a lengthy, cold winter.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Pieces of Mars have fallen to Earth.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">Scientists have found tiny traces of Martian atmosphere within meteorites violently ejected from Mars,<br>
        then orbiting the solar system amongst galactic debris for millions of years, before crash landing on<br>
        Earth. This allowed scientists to begin studying Mars prior to launching space missions.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Mars takes its name from the Roman god of war.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">The ancient Greeks called the planet Ares, after their god of war; the Romans then did likewise,<br>
        associating the planet’s blood-red colour with Mars, their own god of war. Interestingly, other ancient<br>
        cultures also focused on colour – to China’s astronomers it was ‘the fire star’, whilst Egyptian priests<br>
        called on ‘Her Desher’, or ‘the red one’. The red colour Mars is known for is due to the rock and dust<br>
        covering its surface being rich in iron.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>There are signs of liquid water on Mars.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">For years Mars has been known to have water in the form of ice. The first signs of trickling water are<br>
        dark stripes or stains on crater wall and cliffs seen in satellite images. Due to Mars’ atmosphere this<br>
        water would have to be salty to prevent it from freezing or vaporising.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>One day Mars will have a ring.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">In the next 20-40 million years Mars’ largest moon Phobos will be torn apart by gravitational forces<br>
        leading to the creation of a ring that could last up to 100 million years.</p>
    <li style="font-size:120%;"><b>Sunsets on Mars are blue.</b></li>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">During the martian day the sky is pinkish-red, this is the opposite of the Earth’s skies.</p>

<h2>Mars Features</h2>
<p style="font-size:120%;"><b>Moon</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. They were discovered in 1877 by astronomer Asaph Hall,<br>
    who named them for the Latin terms “fear” and “panic”. These moons are thought to be captured asteroids<br>
    and are among the smallest natural satellites in the solar system.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"><b>Olympus Mons</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system – Olympus Mons. It measures some 600 kilometres<br>
    across and rises nearly 27 kilometres above the surrounding terrain. It is a shield volcano built by the<br>
    continuous action of flowing lava over millions and millions of years that began some 3 billion years ago.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Olympus Mons is part of a complex of volcanoes that lie along a volcanic plateau called the Tharsis Bulge.<br>
    This entire region lies over a hotspot, a place in the planet’s crust that allows magma from deep inside to<br>
    flow out to the surface.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;"><b>Valles Marineris</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">The Valles Marineris is an extensive canyon system on the Mars equator. It is 4,200 kilometres long and, in<br>
    places, is 7 kilometres deep. On Earth, it would span the entire North American continent and beyond.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Mars has has a very primitive form of plate tectonics, and the action of two plates past each other began<br>
    splitting the surface some 3.5 billion years ago. That set the stage for the formation of the Valles Marineris.</p>
